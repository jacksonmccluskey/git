touch .gitignore
# -> in many cases, the project creates a lot of log and other irrelevant files which are to be ignored.So to ignore those files, we have to put their names in“.gitignore” file.

echo "filename.ext" >> .gitignore

echo "*.log" > .gitignore
# -> to ignore all files with .log extension

# -> now the filenames written in the .gitignore file would be ignored while pushing a new commit.
