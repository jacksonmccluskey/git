$ git remote add origin http_url/ssh_url 
# -> connect to central repo to push/pull
# -> pull means transferring the changes on the central repository to your local repository. push is the vice versa of pull.

$ git pull origin master
# -> always first pull contents from the central repo before pushing so that you are updated with other team membersâ€™ work
# -> here, master means the master branch (in Git)
